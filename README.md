# mono-vision-ros
ROS-based monocular vision algorithm. 

The standard approach is to extract a sparse set of salient image features (e.g. points,lines) in each image; match them in successive frames using invariant feature descriptors; robustly recover both camera motion and structure using epipolar geometry; finally, refine the pose and structure through reprojection error minimization.

This is a fully robocentric representation of the filter state where we avoid major consistency problems while exhibiting accurate tracking performance and high robustness.
